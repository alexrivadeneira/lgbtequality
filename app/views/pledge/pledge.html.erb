As of September 2016, it is still legal in 30 states to discriminate against and fire LGBTQ people in the workplace just because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  This is because there is no federal law to ensure LGBTQ equality in the workplace.

Regardless of the federal and state laws of where I do business, I cannot tolerate such discrimination.  Therefore, I pledge, as a business leader and manager:

To practice non-discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and
To advocate against discriminatory policies and actions based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace.

I make this pledge because I believe that:

LGBTQ employees are valuable and should have equal protections in the workplace
Fairness and non-discrimination are fundamental to any workplace
Fostering acceptance of diversity returns financial benefits to firms by encouraging full and open participation by all employees
Firms that drive away talented and capable employees are certain to lose their competitive edge in the global marketplace for talent

I am PROUD to stand with my fellow MBA students at UC Berkeleyâ€™s Haas School of Business and make this pledge to ensure LGBTQ equality in the workplace.
